Monolithic Architecture ?
1. Traditional approach to software development
2. Developing a complete application as a single unit
3. Developed single codebase
4. UI, Business and DB calls is in same codebase


**Advantages:** 
Easy to get start and debug

**Disadvantages:** 
Difficult to manage, Hard to implement new features

When to use Monolithic Architecture
1. Small team at Founding Stage
2. Simple application with Predictable Scale and Complexity
3. Proof of Concept and Quick Launch
4. No Microservices Expertise


Benefits of Monolithic Architecture
1. Simple to Develop
2. Easier debugging and testing
3. Simple Deployment


Challenges of Monolithic Architecture
1. Become Complex over time - Hard to Understand
2. Hard to Making New changes
3. Barrier to new technology adoption
4. Difficult to Scale



Design principles - KISS, YAGNI, DRY

***DRY – Don’t Repeat Yourself***
-> Every piece of knowledge must have a single
-> Try to maintain the behavior of a functionality of the system in a single piece of code, it should not have duplicated code or design item.

***KISS – Keep It Simple, Stupid***
-> Make your code or system simple. You should avoid unnecessary complexity
-> A simple code it’s easier to maintain and easier to understand.

***YAGNI – You Ain’t Gonna Need It***
-> Do the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
-> This principle says that you should not create features that it’s not really necessary.
